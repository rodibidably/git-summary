# git-tools
**git-tools is a .NET application that acts as a wrapper around many popular git functions to make development easier**

## git-summary

**git-summary will neatly list the current status of any git repos it finds within any directory (and sub directories) on your system**

**If you ever experienced one of the following situations, git-summary is for you.**
* I don't remember where some of my repositories are...
* Did I forgot to push that commit?
* Do I have a repo in my system that is outdated?
* Did someone pushed new commits to `origin/master` in one of my repos?
* Did I commit that quick change I made before the pizza delivery guy rang my door?

A big thanks to the folks that wrote the (Linux) version of `git-summary` that this borrowed from:

## Branch status
**Coming next in development**

Currently, `git-summary` does not list multiple branches per repo. However, for single repos [`git-branch-status`](https://github.com/bill-auger/git-branch-status) does this beautifully.
